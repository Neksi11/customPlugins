name: animation-mastery
description: Use when working with any web animation tasks, including easing functions, timing patterns, component animations, scroll effects, or choosing between GSAP and Motion.dev
version: 1.0.0
---

Use this skill whenever you're helping with animation-related tasks. The animation expert agent has comprehensive knowledge of:

## Animation Fundamentals
- Easing functions (spring, bezier, elastic, bounce)
- Duration patterns for different interaction types
- Timeline architecture and sequencing
- Performance optimization for 60fps

## Component Animations
- Button hover/click effects
- Card entry/exit and transitions
- Modal dialog animations
- Navigation animations
- List/grid staggered animations
- Form input feedback

## Advanced Techniques
- Scroll-triggered animations (ScrollTrigger, useScroll)
- Parallax effects
- 3D transforms and perspective
- Gesture-based interactions
- SVG path animations
- Physics-based motion

## Library Selection
- GSAP: Complex timelines, precise control, non-React projects
- Motion.dev: React-first, declarative, entry/exit animations

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks about creating animations
- Needs help with animation performance
- Wants to implement hover/click/scroll effects
- Needs to choose an animation library
- Has animation-related bugs or issues
- Wants to improve existing animation code

## Response Approach

1. Understand the animation goal and use case
2. Suggest the appropriate library (GSAP vs Motion.dev)
3. Provide production-ready code with proper configuration
4. Include performance and accessibility considerations
5. Explain the easing and timing choices
6. Offer optimization suggestions if applicable
